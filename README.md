# Neural Machine Translation - English to German
Pytorch implementation of English to German Neural machine translation model.

It is a basic Encoder-Decoder RNN with LSTMs implemented on pytorch. Heavily inspired from [this tutorial.](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq)

Please check other branches of this repo as well. I have implemented several improved versions of this model.
